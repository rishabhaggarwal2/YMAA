        	<p><b>UCLA’s first student­-initiated Alzheimer’s Research­ Scholarship Program</b></p>
            <p class="marginTop20">
			Through ARSP we will channel some of the brightest young minds both at UCLA and across the country to actively work on conducting either clinical or laboratory research related to the disease for a full academic year. We hope that this year of research will inspire a future generation of scholars and scientists to be at the forefront of developing successful treatments or even a cure for this disease. Through a Go­FundMe and an Awards Gala in Fall 2016, we plan to sponsor <b>exceptional undergraduate student researchers </b> to a value of $1000 for the academic year. At UCLA, this program would culminate in a poster/abstract presentation at the UCLA Aging Conference in May.

			Additionally, based on the amount fundraised, we would be able to <b>create this program at other chapters</b> such as Harvard, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and UC Irvine. We have received positive support from multiple faculty members (including the heads of a few departmental programs­) listed below:
