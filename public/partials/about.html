        <h1>PRESIDENTS MESSAGE</h1>
        
        <br>
        <div class="row message">
            <p>
                1906 was when Dr. Alois Alzheimer first discovered a disease that affects 5.4 million Americans today. Over a 110 years later, this top 10 cause of death is without a known cause, cure, or effective treatment. As someone who has done basic science research of progressive neurodegenerative disease since his high school years, I find it amazing how far research has come in understanding mechanistic pathways leading to Alzheimer’s, and I remain optimistic knowing research will continue to learn a lot more in the decade to come. However, I had to do more to learn about the larger implications of this disease. 
            </p>

            <p>
             In late 2014, I joined the Alzheimer's Association's public policy team. On my local team were Lisa and Gary Bricker. Gary was a former attorney who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 63 and Lisa his loving wife and caregiver. Learning about their story, how one disease caused them to shift homes and jobs several times and put them through great economic hardship, I knew I had to learn more. This led me to attending Alzheimer’s Association’s national policy conference in March of 2015. 
         </p>

        <p>
            As a 20 year old attending the conference, I was very excited to find other young members at their Youth Forum. To my surprise, the Youth Forum was for attendees aged 40 and under, and it had about 50 attendees in a conference of over 1100 members.
        </p>

         <p>
             <b>Youth are not involved in Alzheimer's.</b>
         </p>

         <p>
            But of course, why should they be? Is it not a disease that only affects the elderly? True, Alzheimer's generally affects people aged 50 and above, but it can and will affect us one day. More importantly, Alzheimer’s is more than just a disease. It is a huge strain on our national healthcare system. Today, 1 in 5 Medicare and Medicaid dollars goes directly toward Alzheimer's care and that number is estimated to be 1 in 3 as the baby boomer generation comes to age in the next few decades.
        </p>
        <div class="row quote">
            <p><b>The Problem: An impending breakdown of our national healthcare system in the upcoming decades</b><br>
            <b>The solution: none</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Alzheimer's patients and their extremely stressed caregivers are not going to be the voting population that push our Congress members to fund research - that burden falls to us. The older generation will be the ones affected by the disease, but you and I are going to be the ones forced to find solutions to this tough healthcare situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            We cannot solve everything overnight, but our generation must make a genuine start. We are the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s, and we are creating a future worth remembering.
        </p>
        <p>
            With much excitement and warm regards,
        </p>

        <p>Nihal Satyadev, <br>President</p>

During his public service in Washington, D.C., he also served as Staff Director of the U.S. House Select Committee on Aging under his mentor, Congressman Edward R. Roybal. In 2013, he received the coveted John W. Gardner Legacy of Leadership Award from the White House Fellows Foundation and Association.

                    Lené Levy-Storms’ core research concerns the quality of communication between long-term care providers and older adults with dementia, including their family caregivers. In 2003, Dr. Levy-Storms received a career development award from the National Institute on Aging titled, “Therapeutic Communication during Nursing Home Care.” In this five year study, she focused on how to conceptualize, measure, and improve communication between direct care staff and frail, older residents with dementia during nursing home care. In 2005, the National Alzheimer’s Association and the Hartford Foundation awarded Dr. Levy-Storms funds to test her communication training intervention. In 2008, the American Medical Directors Association enabled Dr. Levy-Storms to expand her intervention to family caregivers of nursing home residents with a quality improvement award. In 2010, Dr. Levy-Storms became an Atlantic Philanthropy-funded Health and Aging Policy Fellow during which she explored federal and state policies on direct care staff training in long-term care. In a new collaborative study, funded by the Archstone Foundation in 2013, she is exploring the feasibility of broadening her communication intervention to simultaneously train both direct care staff as well as family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia to communicate well with one another as well as residents with dementia.

                    Lené Levy-Storms’ core research concerns the quality of communication between long-term care providers and older adults with dementia, including their family caregivers. In 2003, Dr. Levy-Storms received a career development award from the National Institute on Aging titled, “Therapeutic Communication during Nursing Home Care.” In this five year study, she focused on how to conceptualize, measure, and improve communication between direct care staff and frail, older residents with dementia during nursing home care. In 2005, the National Alzheimer’s Association and the Hartford Foundation awarded Dr. Levy-Storms funds to test her communication training intervention. In 2008, the American Medical Directors Association enabled Dr. Levy-Storms to expand her intervention to family caregivers of nursing home residents with a quality improvement award. In 2010, Dr. Levy-Storms became an Atlantic Philanthropy-funded Health and Aging Policy Fellow during which she explored federal and state policies on direct care staff training in long-term care. In a new collaborative study, funded by the Archstone Foundation in 2013, she is exploring the feasibility of broadening her communication intervention to simultaneously train both direct care staff as well as family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia to communicate well with one another as well as residents with dementia.
