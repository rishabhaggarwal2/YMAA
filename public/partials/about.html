				1906 was when Dr. Alois Alzheimer first discovered a disease that affects 5.4 million Americans today. Over a 110 years later, this top 10 cause of death is without a known cause, cure, or effective treatment. As someone who has done basic science research of progressive neurodegenerative disease since his high school years, I find it amazing how far research has come in understanding mechanistic pathways leading to Alzheimer’s, and I remain optimistic knowing research will continue to learn a lot more in the decade to come. However, I had to do more to learn about the larger implications of this disease.
			</p>
			<p>
				In late 2014, I joined the Alzheimer's Association's public policy team. On my local team were Lisa and Gary Bricker. Gary was a former attorney who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 63 and Lisa his loving wife and caregiver. Learning about their story, how one disease caused them to shift homes and jobs several times and put them through great economic hardship, I knew I had to learn more. This led me to attending Alzheimer’s Association’s national policy conference in March of 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a 20 year old attending the conference, I was very excited to find other young members at their Youth Forum. To my surprise, the Youth Forum was for attendees aged 40 and under, and it had about 50 attendees in a conference of over 1100 members.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Youth are not involved in Alzheimer's.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				But of course, why should they be? Is it not a disease that only affects the elderly? True, Alzheimer's generally affects people aged 50 and above, but it can and will affect us one day. More importantly, Alzheimer’s is more than just a disease. It is a huge strain on our national healthcare system. Today, 1 in 5 Medicare and Medicaid dollars goes directly toward Alzheimer's care and that number is estimated to be 1 in 3 as the baby boomer generation comes to age in the next few decades.
			</p>
			<div class="row quote">
				<p><b>The Problem: An impending breakdown of our national healthcare system in the upcoming decades</b><br>
					<b>The solution: none</b>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Alzheimer's patients and their extremely stressed caregivers are not going to be the voting population that push our Congress members to fund research - that burden falls to us. The older generation will be the ones affected by the disease, but you and I are going to be the ones forced to find solutions to this tough healthcare situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				We cannot solve everything overnight, but our generation must make a genuine start. We are the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s, and we are creating a future worth remembering.
			</p>
			<p>
				With much excitement and warm regards,
			</p>

He was appointed (with Senate Confirmation) by President Bill Clinton as the first-ever U.S. Assistant Secretary on Aging in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). As the Clinton Administration’s chief advocate on aging, Dr. Torres-Gil played a key role in promoting the importance of the issues of aging, long-term care and disability, community services for the elderly, and baby boomer preparation for retirement. He served under HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, managing the Administration on Aging and organizing the 1995 White House Conference on Aging. In addition, he served as a member of the President’s Welfare Reform Working Group.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 20l0 he received his third presidential appointment (with Senate Confirmation) when President Barack Obama appointed him as Vice Chair of the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency that reports to the Congress and White House on federal matters related to disability policy.  During his public service in Washington, D.C., he also served as Staff Director of the U.S. House Select Committee on Aging under his mentor, Congressman Edward R. Roybal. In 2013, he received the coveted John W. Gardner Legacy of Leadership Award from the White House Fellows Foundation and Association.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the local level, Dr. Torres-Gil has served as Vice President of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission and as a member of the Harbor and Taxi Commissions for the city of Los Angeles. During the administration of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa he served on the Board of Airport Commissioners. At the state level, he was appointed by former Governor Gray Davis to the Governor’s Blue Ribbon Task Force on Veterans’ Homes and by former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as a delegate to the 2005 White House Conference on Aging.
				</p>
				<p>
					He continues to provide important leadership in philanthropy and non-profit organizations including as a board member for AARP. In addition, he is a former board member of The California Endowment; the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, California; and the Los Angeles Chinatown Service Center. He most recently served as a member of the Institute on Medicine’s (IOM) End-of-Life Committee (2013-2014).
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Torres-Gil was born and raised in Salinas, California, the son of migrant farm workers. He earned his A.A. in Political Science at Hartnell Community College (1968), a B.A. with honors in Political Science from San Jose State University (1970), and an M.S.W. (1972) and Ph.D. (1976) in Social Policy, Planning and Research from the Heller Graduate School in Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University.

			Lené Levy-Storms’ core research concerns the quality of communication between long-term care providers and older adults with dementia, including their family caregivers. In 2003, Dr. Levy-Storms received a career development award from the National Institute on Aging titled, “Therapeutic Communication during Nursing Home Care.” In this five year study, she focused on how to conceptualize, measure, and improve communication between direct care staff and frail, older residents with dementia during nursing home care.

In 2008, the American Medical Directors Association enabled Dr. Levy-Storms to expand her intervention to family caregivers of nursing home residents with a quality improvement award. In 2010, Dr. Levy-Storms became an Atlantic Philanthropy-funded Health and Aging Policy Fellow during which she explored federal and state policies on direct care staff training in long-term care. In a new collaborative study, funded by the Archstone Foundation in 2013, she is exploring the feasibility of broadening her communication intervention to simultaneously train both direct care staff as well as family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia to communicate well with one another as well as residents with dementia.

			sourced, cosmetically imperfect fruits and vegetables to fuel a culinary
			arts job training program for men and women coming out of foster care
			and older men and women returning from incarceration.

			Founded in 2013, L.A. Kitchen is now located in a 20,000 sq. ft., two–
			level processing kitchen, located in NE Los Angeles. L.A. Kitchen operates

		<strong>Co-Directors, Brain Health and Alzheimer's Prevention Program - Loma Linda University Medical Center</strong>
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<p>
			A unique husband and wife team on the cutting edge of brain science, Dr. Dean and Dr. Ayesha Sherzai are dedicated to educating people on the simple steps to long-term health and wellness through their work as Directors of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University Medical Center, with patients, as well as through online writing, videos, and books.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is a tsunami of diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer’s, stroke and Parkinson’s disease permeating our culture. In our own communities and families, we all have known at least one person suffering from these illnesses and in many cases seen the fallout first-hand. There is no treatment for these diseases, and the emotional, financial and social burden is immense. These diseases are thieves, stealing time, money and ravaging the minds of our loved ones. The Sherzais see scientists and physicians working furiously to find a cure or these diseases, and in this frantic race against time somehow, the big picture is usually lost among the molecules and chemicals related to the diseases.
		</p>
		<p>
As Directors of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University Medical Center, the Sherzais, through research and their extensive collective medical backgrounds, work to demystify the steps to achieving long-term brain health and the prevention of devastating diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia.
