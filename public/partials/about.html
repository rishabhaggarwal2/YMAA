				1906 was when Dr. Alois Alzheimer first discovered a disease that affects 5.4 million Americans today. Over a 110 years later, this top 10 cause of death is without a known cause, cure, or effective treatment. As someone who has done basic science research of progressive neurodegenerative disease since his high school years, I find it amazing how far research has come in understanding mechanistic pathways leading to Alzheimer’s, and I remain optimistic knowing research will continue to learn a lot more in the decade to come. However, I had to do more to learn about the larger implications of this disease.
			</p>
			<p>
				In late 2014, I joined the Alzheimer's Association's public policy team. On my local team were Lisa and Gary Bricker. Gary was a former attorney who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 63 and Lisa his loving wife and caregiver. Learning about their story, how one disease caused them to shift homes and jobs several times and put them through great economic hardship, I knew I had to learn more. This led me to attending Alzheimer’s Association’s national policy conference in March of 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a 20 year old attending the conference, I was very excited to find other young members at their Youth Forum. To my surprise, the Youth Forum was for attendees aged 40 and under, and it had about 50 attendees in a conference of over 1100 members.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Youth are not involved in Alzheimer's.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				But of course, why should they be? Is it not a disease that only affects the elderly? True, Alzheimer's generally affects people aged 50 and above, but it can and will affect us one day. More importantly, Alzheimer’s is more than just a disease. It is a huge strain on our national healthcare system. Today, 1 in 5 Medicare and Medicaid dollars goes directly toward Alzheimer's care and that number is estimated to be 1 in 3 as the baby boomer generation comes to age in the next few decades.
			</p>
			<div class="row quote">
				<p><b>The Problem: An impending breakdown of our national healthcare system in the upcoming decades</b><br>
					<b>The solution: none</b>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Alzheimer's patients and their extremely stressed caregivers are not going to be the voting population that push our Congress members to fund research - that burden falls to us. The older generation will be the ones affected by the disease, but you and I are going to be the ones forced to find solutions to this tough healthcare situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				We cannot solve everything overnight, but our generation must make a genuine start. We are the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s, and we are creating a future worth remembering.
			</p>
			<p>
				With much excitement and warm regards,
			</p>

		<p>
			Lené Levy-Storms’ core research concerns the quality of communication between long-term care providers and older adults with dementia, including their family caregivers. In 2003, Dr. Levy-Storms received a career development award from the National Institute on Aging titled, “Therapeutic Communication during Nursing Home Care.” In this five year study, she focused on how to conceptualize, measure, and improve communication between direct care staff and frail, older residents with dementia during nursing home care. In 2005, the National Alzheimer’s Association and the Hartford Foundation awarded Dr. Levy-Storms funds to test her communication training intervention. In 2008, the American Medical Directors Association enabled Dr. Levy-Storms to expand her intervention to family caregivers of nursing home residents with a quality improvement award. In 2010, Dr. Levy-Storms became an Atlantic Philanthropy-funded Health and Aging Policy Fellow during which she explored federal and state policies on direct care staff training in long-term care. In a new collaborative study, funded by the Archstone Foundation in 2013, she is exploring the feasibility of broadening her communication intervention to simultaneously train both direct care staff as well as family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia to communicate well with one another as well as residents with dementia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dr. Levy-Storms has B.S. degree in psychology from UC Davis, a MPH in biostatistics and a PhD in public health. From 1998-2000, she was an assistant professor in the Department of Health Promotion and Gerontology and a fellow of the Sealy Center on Aging at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX. In 2000, she joined the UCLA Department of Medicine, Division of Geriatrics as an assistant professor. At that time, she also became an associate director of the UCLA/Borun Center for Gerontological Research, an appointment which she continues to hold. The Borun Center focuses on applied research to improve the quality of life of older adults in long-term care settings. She now holds a joint appointment with Medicine and Social Welfare.

		<h2>Alissa Anderegg</h2>
		<strong>Millennial Caregiver & Miss World America</strong>
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<p>
			Throughout her life, Alissa Anderegg has used her voice to inspire others. From appearing on stage and screen as a professional child actress to speaking around the U.S. as a leading Alzheimer's activist to lending her social media expertise to world-renowned companies— and now as Miss World America 2020— she has lived by her mission to educate, empower and activate. </p>

			<p>A graduate of Duke University with a Master's from Northwestern, Alissa is the current Miss World America, the official United States representative of the longest-running international beauty pageant Miss World. As Miss World America, Alissa is an ambassador for Miss World’s mission of “Beauty with a Purpose,” with a special focus on her personal platform of Alzheimer’s Advocacy. </p>

<p>Growing up with a grandmother with Alzheimer's, Alissa quickly realized that the Alzheimer's community lacked a voice for what she now calls the "forgotten generation" of the disease: the child caregivers. Her story has been featured in the Emmy-winning HBO documentary The Alzheimer’s Project, the TV show Young Icons, Maria Shriver’s Women's Alzheimer's Movement national campaign, AOL, The Huffington Post, National Public Radio, a national keynote speaking tour, and her contribution to the publications The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Takes on Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s in America, among others. In addition to her Alzheimer's work, Alissa has been a longtime philanthropist, contributing over 2,000 community service hours for more than 100 nonprofits.

		<strong>Gen Z Caregiver & Undergraduate Student</strong>
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<p>
			Itzel M. Estrada-Galicia is an undergraduate student who is planning on pursuing a degree within the world of Neuroscience. Her interest stems from the connection she had with her grandmother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease when she was six months old. As Itzel grew her grandmother’s illness progressed she became very close to her because they shared the same interests. They danced, played dress up and did each other’s makeup spending most of their time together. At an early age, Itzel began to understand why they had the bond that they did. She became aware of what Alzheimer’s Disease is and how the illness progressed. As the years passed Itzel went from being her best friend to her caregiver until she peacefully passed in 2020. She would accompany her on walks, dress her, and towards the end spoon-fed her all her meals. </p>
		</p><p>During her freshmen year of high school, Itzel was presented with the opportunity to study and create her own Impact Project. She spent the first two years participating in projects in hopes to create her own by the time her junior year began. In 11th grade, she drafted and created a plan for the type of project that she wanted. Due to the experience she had with the disease at a young age, she saw the lack of resources that were available for young caregivers like herself. During the summer before her senior year, she spent time preparing her action plan and researching various organizations until she found The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). She got in contact with founder Nihal Satyadev and explained the Impact Project that she had created. 
</p><p>In the Fall of her senior year, Itzel began recruiting and establishing her chapter by making school-wide presentations, handing out flyers, having weekly meetings, and signing petitions. She had prepared her chapter for the next steps by presenting and getting in contact with high schools in her area in hopes to reach out to any young caregivers experiencing difficulties but was interrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak. She and her nine chapter-mates had to put their chapter on hold to deal with COVID. Although she has moved on from high school she is planning on bringing a chapter to her college to continue where she left off. 
</p><p>Itzel’s long-term goal is to continue advocating for the advancement of research and awareness while also being involved in the much-needed government change.
