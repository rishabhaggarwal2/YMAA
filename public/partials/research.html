				The <b>Alzheimer’s Research Scholarship Program (ARSP) </b> was founded by YMAA's UCLA chapter in 2016 to reward students who have actively been conducting either humanities or life science research related to Alzheimer’s Disease with a $1000 stipend. Through this program we hope to inspire a future generation of scholars and scientists to be at the forefront of developing successful treatments-- or <b>even a cure</b> for this disease.
