         <h3> Nonprofit volunteers create a platform to address social isolation created by COVID-19 </h3>
        <br>
    
        <p>Our shifting society has made it harder for different generations to connect, and the resulting loneliness takes a big toll on our health. Social distancing from the COVID-19 pandemic has made this even harder. To address this issue, volunteers from the Los Angeles based nonprofit, the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA), built a website, mealstogether.org, that brings together older adults and youth alike to share a meal over video conferencing. The pairing is created by matching people across different generations that have similar interests and speak the same language.</p>

        <p>“Being alone in my home during the pandemic, helped me empathize with all the people who face loneliness throughout most of their old age,” said Rishabh Aggarwal, 24, the lead developer on the project. Mr. Aggarwal is a UI Engineer at Facebook and built the platform in the evenings and weekends. “I saw this as an amazing chance to help people combat this loneliness by connecting them with someone to share a meal with as well as help design and develop a simple and delightful experience for the elderly and youth alike.”</p>

        <p>Within the first week of its launch, MealsTogether signed up 100 users. “The video chat experience is a nice way to connect with each other, and seeing a smiling face is priceless during these uncertain times”, said Kimi Ego, an older adult who recently used the platform.</p>

        <p>MealsTogether is available to be used anywhere across the United States. The nonprofit is now working to bring the platform to function internationally.</p>

        <p>"YMAA aims to increase advocacy around Alzheimer's and dementia. When quarantine measures were put in place for COVID-19, we realized we had to mobilize our community since social isolation has been linked to increases in not only dementia, but also depression, substance abuse, and suicide. COVID-19 has pretty much eliminated services that provided seniors with social connection," said Katherine Rose, 25, the organization’s CEO. "MealsTogether provides older adults with a platform to connect to other generations in this time of crisis. And although it was created as a rapid response to this issue, we hope that in the next year the platform will expand further to partner with assisted living facilities across the nation and match over 5,000 seniors.”</p>

     <h3> COVID-19 Statement </h3>
    <br>

<p> Dear YMAA Community,</p>


<p>In accordance with the national public health warnings, we are taking precautions to prevent the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). </p>


<p>Our in-home intergenerational respite care program, Youthcare, which many of you have supported throughout its development, was scheduled to launch this week. After careful deliberation, the YMAA team has decided to postpone this launch. This decision did not come lightly, but due to the heightened risk toward the elderly population who are more vulnerable to contracting the more severe symptoms of COVID-19, we must be considerate of the people we are servicing, and think of the health and safety of them as well as our volunteers.</p>


<p>Additionally, we are postponing all in-person events and using online methods to conduct meetings. We encourage all of our chapters and chapter members across the country to take the necessary precautions by staying at home and pausing all volunteer activities that involve large gatherings. We also understand that seniors are more likely to be isolated during this time, and we encourage volunteers to participate in senior food drop-offs and to check-in with them via phone. We encourage you all to monitor any information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html">Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</a> as well as any local agencies in order to remain updated on the spread of the disease and prevention methods.</p>


<p>Even though you may not contract the disease, it is very possible that you may spread it to someone who is immunocompromised. The individuals in the YMAA community are passionate leaders, and we would hope to see that translate to matters outside of Alzheimer’s as well, especially regarding health and wellness. We must be smart, protect ourselves, and help protect seniors during this difficult time.</p>


<p>Our team will be working in the next 2 months to determine a more long-term strategy for the continued growth of our movement during the time of this viral spread. Should you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to contact our CEO Kathy Rose directly at <a href="mailto:kathy@youthmovement.org?Subject=COVID19%20Response" target="_top">kathy@theyouthmovement.org.</a></p>



<p>Sincerely, </p>


<p>Kathy Rose <br />
    CEO</p>

     <h3> Small LA-Based Caregiving Nonprofit Startup Wins $100,000 from LA2050 </h3>
    <br>

    <p> <b>LOS ANGELES, CA - Yesterday, The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s, which is run by a staff of volunteers in their early 20s, won $100,000 to support its startup social venture, YouthCare. The grant is sponsored by LA2050, a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. </b></p>

    <p>This year, LA2050 awarded a total of $1 million to 10 organizations spread across five categories as part of its My LA2050 Grants Challenge. Within its category, YouthCare faced tough competition from submissions by USC, UCLA and Planned Parenthood to win the top prize.</p> 

    <p>YouthCare’s founder, 24 year old Nihal Satyadev, said he is excited to see how the funds will help out the local community.</p>

    <p>“If our program reaches 17 percent of people in LA who have dementia today and allows them to age in place by two months, we will save our local healthcare system $1 billion by offsetting costs of assisted living facilities and nursing homes," he said. "I'm thrilled to see how the $100,000 gives us the extra push to expand YouthCare in Los Angeles and eventually bring it to other cities across the country."</p>

    <p>YouthCare is an intergenerational caregiving program that partners trained college student volunteers and older adults with early to mid-stage dementia. When family caregivers utilize this low-cost service, it allows them to free up time to attend their own medical appointments, meet with family or friends or run errands. </p>

    <p>Satyadev said he believes the program will fundamentally change the caregiving landscape. </p>

    <p>“Our current system is completely inadequate," Satyadev said. "Student volunteerism is a key solution to our long term care system."</p>

    <p>This social venture operated for 11 months in partnership with USC’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and stopped operations to shift the setting of service provision. Satyadev plans to restart the program within the next six months and serve persons with dementia directly in their own homes. </p>

     <h3> Leeza Gibbons launches Dare to Care Week </h3>
     <h4> <i> Leeza Gibbons, an honorary board member of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's, launches a campaign to support intergenerational caregiving innovation </i> </h4>
    <br>

    <p> <b>LOS ANGELES, CA -- From April 22nd to April 29th, The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's (YMAA) is hosting its #daretocare week, encouraging individuals of all ages to support intergenerational caregiving innovation. Dare to Care Week asks supporters to vote for YMAA's chance to win $100k through the LA2050 Grant's Challenge and to advocate for the California Care Corps. Leeza Gibbons will be launching the campaign through her Instagram page, and the campaign will include Alzheimer's advocacy champions like Liz Hernandez, Cristina Ferrare, Joan Lunden and many more!</b></p>

    <p>The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's, led by a 24-year-old student entrepreneur Nihal Satyadev, is the largest youth-led Alzheimer’s 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the nation, actively engaging more than 500 students. The nonprofit is using innovative approaches to support family caregivers who are taking care of persons with dementia. Dare to Care Week is an effort to help the nonprofit reach its most ambitious goals yet - winning a $100,000 grant to expand its social enterprise and supporting legislation that is creating the next national service model. </p> 

	<p>With its innovative social enterprise, YouthCare-- which launched last year at the University of Southern California and won George Washington University's Graduate Social Venture Prize last week-- YMAA hopes to create dramatic cost savings to the Los Angeles healthcare system. The primary goal is to increase the ability of elders with Alzheimer’s to age in their own homes by overcoming caregiver burden barriers. To achieve this, YouthCare pairs trained undergraduate students with these older adults. The cost of two years of this program could be subsidized by one month of cost savings at Assisted Living Facilities. </p>

	<p>YMAA is also a lead sponsor, along with Alzheimer's San Diego, of the California Care Corps (Assembly Bill 568 via Assemblymember Eloise Gómez Reyes), an initiative that has the potential to become the next major national service program. "California has a history of leading the nation through innovation and this is on brand for our state," said Satyadev. "This is an opportunity for youth to express their love for our country in a way that actually lowers the cost burden on our healthcare system." </p>

     <h3> David vs. Goliaths: Who Will Win LA2050? </h3>
     <h4> <i> The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s, headed by 23 year old CEO, makes it to the final round </i> </h4>
    <br>

    <p> <b> LOS ANGELES, CA -- LA2050 funds promising nonprofits with significant potential to move Los Angeles forward. Their $200,000 grand prize is awarded each year to five nonprofits whose advances in various sectors are helping to make LA the best city in the country. Past recipients include well known titans i like Opportunity Fund, Homeboy Industries, and City Year LA. </b></p>

    <p> One of this year’s finalists stands out not only for its contribution to LA but also for its ambitious young leaders. Led by 23 year old CEO, Nihal Satyadev, The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s is a nonprofit using innovative approaches to address the disease. There is no one in the organization who is over 25 years old, and the day- to- day operation are handled almost exclusively by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) students or alumni who dedicate their free time to inspire their generation to find creative solutions for those with Alzheimer’s. With their innovative social enterprise, YouthCare, which recently launched at the University of Southern California (USC), the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s hopes to create dramatic cost savings for our healthcare system by increasing the ability of older adults with Alzheimer’s to age in their home by overcoming caregiver burden barriers. To achieve this, YouthCare pairs trained undergraduate students with these older adults. The cost of two years of this program can be subsidized by one month of cost savings at Assisted Living Facilities. Satyadev, has been on a personal mission to transform the national discussion around how this disease affects multiple generations. Through this model, he wants to expand care access to the estimated 200,000 Angelenos who are currently providing unpaid family care to a loved one with dementia. “We have the opportunity to create billions of dollars in cost savings when we grow nationally,” said Satyadev. “What’s potentially even more exciting is that we can cut costs while also lowering rates of depression for family caregivers.” </p>

    <br>
     <h3> YouthCare – lowest cost ‘respite care’ option in the country launches at USC</h3>
    <br>
    <p> <b> LOS ANGELES, CA -- On Tuesday, February 13th, <a href="https://youthcaregiving.org/">YouthCare</a>, an intergenerational respite care service for  Alzheimer’s and dementia caregivers, launches in a joint venture between the <a href="http://gero.usc.edu/">University of Southern California Leonard Davis School of Gerontology</a> and the <a href="http://www.theyouthmovement.org/#/">Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s</a> (YMAA). </b></p>
    <p> Transformation is coming to the Alzheimer’s and dementia (AD) caregiving landscape. As the caregiver population balloons, a new social enterprise is stepping into the marketplace to provide respite care services for caregivers at an affordable price and at a delivery scale that existing providers do not offer.  Launched as a partnership between the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the Youth Movement Against Alzheimers, YouthCare could change millions of caregivers’, students’, and patients’ lives.</p>
    <p> The program’s innovative model partners undergraduate and graduate students with older adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia for three hours, twice a week in a community-setting. The simple partnership has major benefits. </p>
    <p> The majority of the 16 million unpaid dementia caregivers throughout the United States cannot afford respite care or cannot find service providers with options less than 10 hours per week. YouthCare’s low-cost per hour and the option to only get three or six hours of respite a week promises major relief to all caregivers and especially the 40% who suffer from diagnosed depression.</p>
    <p>“We hope to help build a robust intergenerational program that benefits the community, helps humanize the aging experience, and gives older adults a chance to spend time with young people who are engaged in improving aging and aging services today and in the future,” said Anna Quyen Nguyen, director of internship training at the USC Leonard Davis School.</p>
    <p> Research has shown that access to respite care  can lengthen stay at home for persons with dementia due to the ease of caregiver burnout. Two years of YouthCare can be subsidized by just one month of cost savings from Assisted Living Facilities. Nihal Satyadev, the CEO & Co-Founder of YMAA stated, “Through this social enterprise, our organization is looking to fundamentally change the landscape of Alzheimer’s care and reduce the burden caused by this disease for families and our healthcare system.” </p>
    <p> Students seeking to develop a geriatric service skill set have a major opportunity to learn how to provide high quality respite care services for AD patients. These skills are experiencing explosive demand as the American population ages. By 2030, for the first time in our history, 20% of Americans will be over sixty-five (up from 15% in 2015). The demand in every corner of the country for respite care services is going to increase alongside that figure.</p>
    <p>  AD diagnoses are forecast to double from 5.5 million to 11 million over the next 12 years. For the many folks who will be aging at home, keeping regular social contact is essential for wellbeing.  YouthCare offers regular social interaction in an educational and clinically prepared setting to serve folks living with AD.  </p>

    <p>YouthCare has already recruited more than 20 USC students and will be ready to start serving caregivers starting February 13th. Referrals for the program for caregivers primarily come from <a href="http://www.alzgla.org/">Alzheimer’s Greater Los Angeles</a> and the <a href="https://www.fcscgero.org/">USC Family Caregiver Support Center</a>. Student recruitment is done through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/USCSGA/"> USC Student Gerontology Association </a></p>
