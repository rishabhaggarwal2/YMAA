     <h3> Leeza Gibbons launches Dare to Care Week </h3>
     <h4> <i> Leeza Gibbons, an honorary board member of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's, launches a campaign to support intergenerational caregiving innovation </i> </h4>
    <br>

    <p> <b>LOS ANGELES, CA -- From April 22nd to April 29th, The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's (YMAA) is hosting its #daretocare week, encouraging individuals of all ages to support intergenerational caregiving innovation. Dare to Care week asks supporters to vote in YMAA's chance to win $100k through the LA2050 Grant's Challenge and to advocate for the California Care Corps. Leeza Gibbons will be launching the campaign through her instagram page, and the campaign will include Alzheimer's advocacy champions like Liz Hernandez, Cristina Ferrare, Joan Lunden, and many more!</b></p>

    <p>The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's, led by a 24 year old student-entrepreneur, is the largest youth-led Alzheimer’s 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the nation - actively engaging over 500 students. The nonprofit is using innovative approaches to support family caregivers who are taking care of persons with dementia. Dare to Care week is an effort to help the nonprofit reach its most ambitious goals yet - winning at $100,000 grant to expand its social enterprise and supporting legislation that is creating the next national service model. </p> 

	<p>With their innovative social enterprise, YouthCare, which launched last year at the University of Southern California (USC) and won the George Washington University's Graduate Social Venture Prize last week, YMAA hopes to create dramatic cost savings for Los Angeles' healthcare system by increasing the ability of older adults with Alzheimer’s to age in their home by overcoming caregiver burden barriers. To achieve this, YouthCare pairs trained undergraduate students with these older adults. The cost of two years of this program can be subsidized by one month of cost savings at Assisted Living Facilities. </p>

	<p>YMAA is also a lead sponsor, along with Alzheimer's San Diego, of the California Care Corps (Assembly Bill 568 via Assemblymember Reyes) - an initiative that has the potential to become the next major national service program. "California has a history of leading the nation through innovation and this is on brand for our state," said Satyadev. "This is an opportunity for youth to express their love for our country in a way that actually lowers the cost burden on our healthcare system" </p>

     <h3> David vs. Goliaths: Who Will Win LA2050? </h3>
     <h4> <i> The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s, headed by 23 year old CEO, makes it to the final round </i> </h4>
    <br>

    <p> <b> LOS ANGELES, CA -- LA2050 funds promising nonprofits with significant potential to move Los Angeles forward. Their $200,000 grand prize is awarded each year to five nonprofits whose advances in various sectors are helping to make LA the best city in the country. Past recipients include well known titans i like Opportunity Fund, Homeboy Industries, and City Year LA. </b></p>

    <p> One of this year’s finalists stands out not only for its contribution to LA but also for its ambitious young leaders. Led by 23 year old CEO, Nihal Satyadev, The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s is a nonprofit using innovative approaches to address the disease. There is no one in the organization who is over 25 years old, and the day- to- day operation are handled almost exclusively by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) students or alumni who dedicate their free time to inspire their generation to find creative solutions for those with Alzheimer’s. With their innovative social enterprise, YouthCare, which recently launched at the University of Southern California (USC), the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s hopes to create dramatic cost savings for our healthcare system by increasing the ability of older adults with Alzheimer’s to age in their home by overcoming caregiver burden barriers. To achieve this, YouthCare pairs trained undergraduate students with these older adults. The cost of two years of this program can be subsidized by one month of cost savings at Assisted Living Facilities. Satyadev, has been on a personal mission to transform the national discussion around how this disease affects multiple generations. Through this model, he wants to expand care access to the estimated 200,000 Angelenos who are currently providing unpaid family care to a loved one with dementia. “We have the opportunity to create billions of dollars in cost savings when we grow nationally,” said Satyadev. “What’s potentially even more exciting is that we can cut costs while also lowering rates of depression for family caregivers.” </p>

     <h3> YouthCare – lowest cost ‘respite care’ option in the country launches at USC</h3>
    <br>
    <p> <b> LOS ANGELES, CA -- On Tuesday, February 13th, <a href="https://youthcaregiving.org/">YouthCare</a>, an intergenerational respite care service for  Alzheimer’s and dementia caregivers, launches in a joint venture between the <a href="http://gero.usc.edu/">University of Southern California Leonard Davis School of Gerontology</a> and the <a href="http://www.theyouthmovement.org/#/">Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s</a> (YMAA). </b></p>
    <p> Transformation is coming to the Alzheimer’s and dementia (AD) caregiving landscape. As the caregiver population balloons, a new social enterprise is stepping into the marketplace to provide respite care services for caregivers at an affordable price and at a delivery scale that existing providers do not offer.  Launched as a partnership between the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the Youth Movement Against Alzheimers, YouthCare could change millions of caregivers’, students’, and patients’ lives.</p>
    <p> The program’s innovative model partners undergraduate and graduate students with older adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia for three hours, twice a week in a community-setting. The simple partnership has major benefits. </p>
    <p> The majority of the 16 million unpaid dementia caregivers throughout the United States cannot afford respite care or cannot find service providers with options less than 10 hours per week. YouthCare’s low-cost per hour and the option to only get three or six hours of respite a week promises major relief to all caregivers and especially the 40% who suffer from diagnosed depression.</p>
    <p>“We hope to help build a robust intergenerational program that benefits the community, helps humanize the aging experience, and gives older adults a chance to spend time with young people who are engaged in improving aging and aging services today and in the future,” said Anna Quyen Nguyen, director of internship training at the USC Leonard Davis School.</p>
    <p> Research has shown that access to respite care  can lengthen stay at home for persons with dementia due to the ease of caregiver burnout. Two years of YouthCare can be subsidized by just one month of cost savings from Assisted Living Facilities. Nihal Satyadev, the CEO & Co-Founder of YMAA stated, “Through this social enterprise, our organization is looking to fundamentally change the landscape of Alzheimer’s care and reduce the burden caused by this disease for families and our healthcare system.” </p>
    <p> Students seeking to develop a geriatric service skill set have a major opportunity to learn how to provide high quality respite care services for AD patients. These skills are experiencing explosive demand as the American population ages. By 2030, for the first time in our history, 20% of Americans will be over sixty-five (up from 15% in 2015). The demand in every corner of the country for respite care services is going to increase alongside that figure.</p>
    <p>  AD diagnoses are forecast to double from 5.5 million to 11 million over the next 12 years. For the many folks who will be aging at home, keeping regular social contact is essential for wellbeing.  YouthCare offers regular social interaction in an educational and clinically prepared setting to serve folks living with AD.  </p>

    <p>YouthCare has already recruited more than 20 USC students and will be ready to start serving caregivers starting February 13th. Referrals for the program for caregivers primarily come from <a href="http://www.alzgla.org/">Alzheimer’s Greater Los Angeles</a> and the <a href="https://www.fcscgero.org/">USC Family Caregiver Support Center</a>. Student recruitment is done through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/USCSGA/"> USC Student Gerontology Association </a></p>
